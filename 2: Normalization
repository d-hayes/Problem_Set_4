Description:
This dataset is about 891 of the passengers aboard the Titanic. This includes personal information regarding each passenger, such as familiy present and socio-economic status. 

Tables:
To use this data, I want to compare each passenger by spcio-economic status. Therefore, I will make a table for each Passenger Class (which is indicative of socio-economic status).
This will allow quick comparison of passenger class.
