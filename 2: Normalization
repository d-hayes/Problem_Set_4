Description:
This dataset is about 891 of the passengers aboard the Titanic. This includes personal information regarding each passenger, such as familiy present and socio-economic status. 

Tables:
To use this data, I want to compare each passenger by spcio-economic status. Therefore, I will make a table for each Passenger Class (which is indicative of socio-economic status).
This will allow quick comparison of passenger class. 

Table 1: Passenger Class 1 (Pclass, INTEGER)
Column names: 
PassengerId	(INTEGER)
Survived (BOOLEAN)
Name (TINYTEXT)
Sex (STRING)
Age (INTEGER)
SibSp	(INTEGER)
Parch	(INTEGER)
Ticket (STRING)
Fare (FLOAT)
Cabin	(STRING)
Embarked (STRING)
Primary Key: Pclass = 1 (INTEGER)
Foregin Key: Pclass =2,3 (INTEGER)

Table 2: Passenger Class 2

Embarked (STRING)
Primary Key: Pclass = 2 (INTEGER)
Foregin Key: Pclass =1,3 (INTEGER)

Table 2: Passenger Class 3
